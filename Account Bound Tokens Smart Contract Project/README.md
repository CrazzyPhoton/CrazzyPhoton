### [MASTERWEB3](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/CrazzyPhoton/blob/main/Account%20Bound%20Tokens%20Smart%20Contract%20Project/MASTERWEB3.sol)
*The **MASTERWEB3** smart contract is designed to issue and manage digital certificates as ERC721 NFTs for students who have completed the Master Web3 course. It enables the course provider to mint new certificates and securely transfer them to students' wallets. The contract incorporates security measures to prevent unauthorized transfers and tracks the total number of minted and burned certificates. Students can view their certificates using a central metadata URL, and the course provider can update this URL to refresh the certificate details for the entire collection. Additionally, the contract allows for verification of student ownership of certificates based on their wallet addresses.*
