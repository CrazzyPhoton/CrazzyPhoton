It manages escrows through various states like Created, Funded, Delivered, and Completed, with features for marking deliveries, requesting revisions, and handling disputes or cancellations.

The contract allows escrow creation, funding, and tracks issue or cancellation requests through mappings, while providing flexibility in fees and automatic withdrawal times. Multiple events ensure transparency throughout the escrow process.*
