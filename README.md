*The **MASTERWEB3** smart contract is designed to issue and manage digital certificates as ERC721 non-transferable account bound NFTs for students who have completed the Master Web3 course. It enables the course provider to mint new certificates and securely transfer them to students' wallets. The contract incorporates security measures to prevent unauthorized transfers and tracks the total number of minted and burned certificates. Students can view their certificates using a central metadata URL, and the course provider can update this URL to refresh the certificate details for the entire collection. Additionally, the contract allows for verification of student ownership of certificates based on their wallet addresses.*

Implemented Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, and other OpenZeppelin upgradeable patterns, enabling upgrades without redeployment. Implemented a client requested feature which allows the ability to amalgamate NFTs into new ones using either one or two parent NFTs, and the integration of ERC20 tokens for this process. Used the merkle proof library of OpenZeppelin for implementing a gas efficient whitelist minting feature.*

## PERSONAL PROJECTS:-
## [1) Escrow Smart Contract Project](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/CrazzyPhoton/tree/main/Escrow%20Smart%20Contracts%20Project)

### [ERC20 Escrow](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/CrazzyPhoton/blob/main/Escrow%20Smart%20Contracts%20Project/ERC20%20Escrow%20Smart%20Contract.sol)

*The **Ethereum, NFT, and ERC20** escrow smart contracts facilitate secure transactions between buyers and sellers by acting as intermediaries. The contracts manage the process through various states, such as creation, funding, delivery, and completion. They incorporate built-in functions to handle disputes, revisions, and cancellations, ensuring smooth and transparent interactions between parties. An arbiter plays a critical role in overseeing conflicts, fairly allocating funds to the buyer, seller, and themselves based on the resolution, while also managing fees.*

*The contracts log all actions through events like "EscrowCreated," "EscrowFunded," and "EscrowCompleted," providing an audit trail that enhances transparency. Flexible configurations, such as setting the escrow provider fee and automatic withdrawal time, allow the arbiter to adjust the system to specific needs. Additionally, mappings keep track of each partyâ€™s escrows, issues, and cancellation requests, offering users clear visibility of their active and completed transactions. These features work together to protect the interests of all involved parties while ensuring the security and reliability of the escrow process.*

## [2) Smart Contract Wallet Project](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/CrazzyPhoton/tree/main/Smart%20Contract%20Wallet%20Project)
**Created a smart contract which acts a wallet for cryptocurrency and NFTs compatible with EVM, this was a personal project.**
### [Smart Contract Wallet](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/CrazzyPhoton/blob/main/Smart%20Contract%20Wallet%20Project/Smart%20Contract%20Wallet.sol)
*The **Smart Contract Wallet** serves as a digital safe for storing and managing various cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum and EVM compatible blockchains. It allows the owner to securely deposit and withdraw Ethereum (ETH) and other tokens like ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. The contract incorporates safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and ensures that the owner has sufficient funds before making transactions.*
