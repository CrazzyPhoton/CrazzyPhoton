**Created 3 smart contracts for a client from France for their art gallery.**
### [Artist Profiler Gallery](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/SmartContractProjects/blob/main/Smart%20Contracts%20For%20Art%20Gallery%20Project/Artist%20Profiler%20Gallery.sol)
*The **Artist Profiler Gallery** smart contract releases annual art gallery editions as ERC1155 NFT tokens. It uses custom logic for managing both current and past editions and includes functionality for buying, selling, and handling royalties.*
### [Portraits](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/SmartContractProjects/blob/main/Smart%20Contracts%20For%20Art%20Gallery%20Project/Portraits.sol)
*The **Portraits** smart contract releases annual artist portraits as ERC1155 NFTs. It features logic for managing portraits of collaborating artists and supports handling previous portrait editions.*
### [Buy And Sell](https://github.com/CrazzyPhoton/SmartContractProjects/blob/main/Smart%20Contracts%20For%20Art%20Gallery%20Project/BuyAndSell.sol)
*The **Buy and Sell** smart contract facilitates listing, buying, and canceling token sales of the **Portraits** smart contract, controlled by the owner. Sellers list tokens, set prices, and buyers purchase by paying the price plus royalties. The contract manages listings, royalty distribution, and emits events for sales and cancellations.*
